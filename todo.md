- [ ] Add user authenitication and conversation history to the chat. I'm ok with a single user, I just need auth so that we can have conversation history
- [X] Add file handling. During conversation, if user uploads a file, I need it to be handled. Likely best case for now is to send the image or pdf to the AI, or other easily handled files. Ignore things that can't be handled.
- [ ] Maybe give AI the ability to store the file and have it indexed.
